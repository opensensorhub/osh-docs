# OpenSensorHub Web APIs

OpenSensorHub offers **several ways of exchanging data** with external systems, including observation data, metadata and commands.

The core team maintains the following Web services and APIs to provide this type of connectivity:

  - [Sensor Observation Service](./swe-services/sos)
  - [Sensor Planning Service](./swe-services/sps)
  - [Sensor Web API](./sensorweb-api/intro)
  - [SensorThings API](./sensorthings-api/intro)
  

In addition to these existing service modules, many others can be created thanks to OSH modular architecture and APIs. This allows connecting to any external service whether they are standard interfaces or proprietary protocols.
