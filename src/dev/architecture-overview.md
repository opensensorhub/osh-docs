**Real-Time Device Drivers**



**Database Connectors**

Any database can be used to persist data generated by OSH if the proper connector is developed. This is done by implementing the **Database API**(). Once a connector is available, observations from any sensor can be persisted and retrieved by any other module, including web service and API modules such as SOS, SensorWeb API and SensorThings API.



**Event Bus**
