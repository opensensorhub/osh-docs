## Releases

Binary and Source distributions archives can be downloaded directly from the [Releases Section](https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-js/releases) of our GitHub account

The release contains a vendor directory (needed for some pre-coded views), the minified osh-js library and its corresponding stylesheet. You can use both the all-in-one vendor minified script(vendor.js & vendor.css) or the separate ones.

You can import the source directory directly into your APP application and refer to it. The Toolkit is ES6 compliant.

`osh-js` no longer comes with prebuilt release versions, so an alternative option to downloading the repo is **strongly** advised.
