# OpenSensorHub Android Installation Guide


## Overview

OpenSensorHub (OSH) allows users to deploy an OSH node on an Android device (phone or tablet) to stream real-time sensor data, including GPS location, orientation, and video, to an OSH Cloud hub. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing and setting up the OSH app on an Android device.
<!-- 
OpenSensorHub (OSH) can be deployed on any Android device. This allows all sensors on the Android phone (including Bluetooth connected sensors) to be sent and managed the by OSH hub. 

All observations are sent in real-time to an OSH Node deployed on a computer or cloud through a transactional SOS service and now it supports the Connected Systems API service.

The instructions below are a guide to adding the OSH app to your Android device, setting up real-time streaming of sensor data (e.g. location, orientation, and video) to an OSH Node or Cloud and immediate visualization of this data on the respected web client: SOS-T or Connecected Systems API Client.  -->
