OpenSensorHub on Android
===

The core modules of OpenSensorHub (OSH) can run natively on Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and later versions. We are also working on a working version for Android 4.4 (KitKat).

Android support is still experimental at this stage although it is already functional to send phone sensor data to a remote OSH node.

The Android specific part is composed of a Service component that wraps the OSH engine and an demo application that can be configured to send data from one or more phone sensors to the SOS server of a remote OSH node.
