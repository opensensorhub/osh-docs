Once you know how to build and launch an **OpenSensorHub** node, 
you can use it for a wide variety of use cases.

Use **OpenSensorHub** as:
- commercial IoT management/data platform
- common operating picture (COP) backend for tactical exercises
- personal home security backend
- a way to control a fleet of robots, UAVs, etc.
- a network of sensors/actuators with autonomous communication between OSH nodes

The possibilities are **endless**!
