<h3 id="exploring-the-code">Exploring the Code</h3>
<p>If you just want to explore the code, you can browse the source online directly on <a href="https://github.com/opensensorhub">Github</a>. Alternatively, you can download it to your computer using the <strong>Download ZIP</strong> link on each GitHub repository or using the <code>git</code> program (see next section).</p>
<p>There are many different repositories that contain various modules for OpenSensorHub. You can browse them all on <a href="https://github.com/opensensorhub">Github</a> so you can decide which ones are of interest for you but here is a summary of the most important ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core Modules: <a href="https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core">https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core</a> </li>
<li>Communication Protocols: <a href="https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-comm">https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-comm</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="getting-the-code">Getting the Code</h3>
<p>The <code>git</code> command is used to download the code from the Github repositories. For example, you can download the code for the core modules using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core.git
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note: You need to use the <code>--recursive</code> option on the osh-core repository because it contains submodules</em></p>
<h3 id="building-from-source">Building from Source</h3>
<p>This guide covers building from source using Gradle on the command line or by importing the Gradle projects into an Eclipse workspace. In both cases you will need a working <strong>JDK8 installation</strong> (both OpenJDK 8 and OracleJDK 8 should work).</p>
<p><em>Note: JDK8 is only needed for building. Once built, OpenSensorHub itself runs on Java 7 and up</em></p>
<h4 id="building-with-gradle">Building with Gradle</h4>
<p>The following instructions are for building using the Gradle Wrapper command <code>gradlew</code> (or <code>gradlew.bat</code> on Windows). This small executable is included in the repository and will automatically fetch the correct version of Gradle for you. If you want to use your own version of Gradle, use the <code>gradle</code> command instead, but please note that our build scripts need version 3.1 or later to get support for composite builds. If you want to install Gradle yourself we recommend downloading it directly from the <a href="https://gradle.org/gradle-download/">Gradle Website</a> as packages provided in Linux distributions may only include earlier versions.</p>
<h5 id="building-the-core-modules">Building the core modules</h5>
<p>Use the following command to clone the <a href="https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core">osh-core</a> repository:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core
</code></pre>

<p>You can then build the code using the gradle wrapper command <code>gradlew</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ cd osh-core
$ ./gradlew build
</code></pre>

<p>This command will build a JAR file for each module in the corresponding subfolder <code>{module-name}/build/libs</code> as well as a ZIP file containing all built module JARs in <code>build/distributions</code>.</p>
<p>You can optionally install the generated artifacts to your local Maven repository with:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ ./gradlew install
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note 1: The first time you launch Gradle, the build process can take a while because Gradle fetches its own dependencies (i.e. Gradle plugins) as well as OpenSensorHub's dependencies. Later builds will go faster because these dependencies are cached locally.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 2: Some of the JUnit tests automatically run during the 'test' phase of the OSH build process need to instantiate a server on port 8888. These tests will fail if something else is running on this port.</em></p>
<h5 id="building-sensor-modules">Building sensor modules</h5>
<p>Sensor drivers are provided in various <a href="https://github.com/opensensorhub?q=osh-sensors">osh-sensors-***</a> repositories. First clone one of these repos in the same folder as osh-core (i.e. <code>osh-core</code> and <code>osh-sensors</code> must be sibbling directories):</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-sensors
</code></pre>

<p>Some sensor drivers need specific communication modules to work (e.g. RXTX serial comm or Bluetooth LE). If you're building a dev version, you'll also have to build these modules from source code. For this, clone the <a href="https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-comm">osh-comm</a> repository at the same level as the other repos:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-comm
</code></pre>

<p>Sensor drivers can be built individually depending which one you are interested in. To start with, you can build the simulated sensors since they don't require you to connect any hardware.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ cd osh-sensors
$ ./gradlew sensorhub-driver-fakegps:build
$ ./gradlew sensorhub-driver-fakeweather:build
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting JAR files will be located in the <code>sensorhub-driver-fakegps/build/libs</code> and <code>sensorhub-driver-fakeweather/build/libs</code> folders respectively.</p>
<p>You can also build all of them at once by running the following command in the <code>osh-sensors</code> folder:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ ./gradlew build
</code></pre>

<p>This will build ZIP files (one for stable modules, one for dev) containing all sensor drivers in the <code>build/distributions</code> folder.</p>
<h5 id="building-other-modules">Building other modules</h5>
<p>You can also clone other repositories of the project and build other types of modules by following the same approach. See the list of module repositories in the <a href="#exploring-the-code">Exploring the Code</a> section.</p>
<h5 id="building-zip-distributions">Building ZIP distributions</h5>
<p>Distribution build scripts are located in the <a href="https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-distros">osh-distros</a> repository. Clone it in the same folder as the other repositories <code>osh-core</code>, <code>osh-comm</code>, <code>osh-sensors</code> (most distributions will require at least these three other folders to build):</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-distros
</code></pre>

<p>Each distribution has its own separate subfolder. The base distribution is in <code>osh-base</code> for example. You can build an installable ZIP package for each distribution, by going to the corresponding subfolder and launching <code>gradlew</code> from there (Note that the gradle wrapper <code>gradlew</code> is provided only once in the repo root folder, so you have to call it with <code>../</code>). For example, to build the <code>osh-base</code> distribution, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ cd osh-distros/osh-base
$ ../gradlew build
</code></pre>

<p>The distribution is built in the <code>build/distributions</code> folder. You can unzip it and run OpenSensorHub using the launch script (it will run with the provided example configuration file, including some simulated sensors, storage databases and an SOS service). Please see the <a href="../../install/">Installation Guide</a> for more details.</p>
<h4 id="building-with-eclipse">Building with Eclipse</h4>
<p>You can build and run the code using the Eclipse IDE by importing the Gradle projects using Eclipse Buildship plugin. </p>
<h5 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h5>
<p>Make sure you have the following Eclipse components installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eclipse Neon</strong> or newer (the exact steps described here are for Neon)</li>
<li><strong>Egit Plugin</strong> for Eclipse (included in "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" release)</li>
<li><strong>Buildship Plugin</strong> for Eclipse v2.0.0 or newer (Buildship is included in the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" release but you'll need to upgrade it to a newer version. See below for instructions)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="upgrade-the-buildship-plugin">Upgrade the Buildship plugin</h5>
<ul>
<li>Go to "Help &gt; Install New Software" in the main menu</li>
<li>Add a new <strong>Update Site</strong> by clicking "Add..." at the top right</li>
<li>Set name to "Buildship Snapshots" and location to the following URL: <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/buildship/updates/e46/snapshots/2.x">http://download.eclipse.org/buildship/updates/e46/snapshots/2.x</a></li>
<li>Select the newly created update site in the list</li>
<li>Select "Buildship: Eclipse Plug-ins for Gradle" in the tree</li>
<li>Click "Next" to start the upgrade process to v2.0.0</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="import-the-source-code-in-your-eclipse-workspace">Import the source code in your Eclipse workspace</h5>
<p>First <strong>clone all the desired projects</strong> in your worskpace (see the <a href="#getting-the-code">Getting the Code</a> section), for instance:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core
$ git clone https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-comm
$ git clone https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-sensors
$ git clone https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-distros
</code></pre>

<p>Then import each repository as a Gradle project using the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Package Explorer</strong>, right click and select "Import" from the popup menu</li>
<li>Open the "Gradle" category, select "Existing Gradle Project" and click "Next"</li>
<li>Click "Next" on the wizard welcome page</li>
<li>Set the "Project root directory" by browsing to the location of your local clone of the repository</li>
<li>Click "Finish"</li>
<li>All projects should be imported successfully and visible in the Package Explorer. Everything should compile without error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since OSH consists of many modules, each of which will become a separate Eclipse project, we recommend that you group projects into Working Sets (for example, one working set per repo)</p>
<h5 id="eclipse-tips">Eclipse Tips</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Everytime a change is made to the Gradle build scripts, the Eclipse project settings must be updated with the    following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click one of the OSH module project</li>
<li>Select "Gradle &gt; Refresh Gradle Project..." from the context menu</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="contributing">Contributing</h3>
<p>If you want to contribute, we feel the best way is that you create your own fork on GitHub, work on it, and when you have something working and tested, send us a Pull Request. To set this up, please follow the steps below:</p>
<h4 id="fork-one-or-more-repository-of-the-project">Fork one or more repository of the project</h4>
<p>The first step is to fork a repo by clicking the <a href="http://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">Fork</a> button on GitHub. This will clone the original code to your own GitHub account so you can then modify it and/or add to it as you wish. For this you'll need to have a GitHub account (it can be done in 30s using your email address) and log into it.</p>
<p>Forking the project this way will allow you to send us <a href="http://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">Pull Requests</a> via GitHub which makes it much easier for us to incorporate your contribution to the master branch. In addition, it creates a community around the software and lets others see what contributors are up to even before a patch is submitted. This can help you get the proper guidance when necessary.</p>
<h4 id="clone-your-github-repository">Clone your GitHub repository</h4>
<p>Clone your new GitHub repository locally by following the steps in the <a href="#building-from-source">Building from Source</a> section except you'll be using your own fork URL (e.g. https://github.com/yourusername/osh-*<em><em>) instead of the </em>opensensorhub</em> version.</p>
<h4 id="work-on-something-new">Work on something new!</h4>
<p>You can then start modifying the code and/or add new modules/features. We don't have coding guidelines yet but try to mimic the code that is already there. Don't forget to include Javadoc, especially on public parts of your APIs, and also inline comments explaining the different steps of your code.</p>
<p>Whether you're trying to fix bugs or adding a brand new functionality, don't hesitate to tell us early-on what you're planning to work on. We may be able to point you in the right direction or maybe to somebody who has similar needs than you.</p>
<p>You can start by reading the instructions to <a href="../sensorhub-core/adding-new-modules.html">Create a New Module</a> and <a href="../sensorhub-core/your-first-sensor.html">Add a New Sensor Driver</a> for instance.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="#eclipse-tips">Eclipse Tips</a> section if you encounter problems while creating a new module.</p>
<h4 id="get-the-latest-updates-from-us">Get the latest updates from us</h4>
<p>While you're working on your stuff, don't forget to pull changes from the main repository once in a while. This will greatly help us merge your changes into the main branch when we receive your Pull Request. You can either do that from command line git or within Eclipse:</p>
<h5 id="using-the-git-command">Using the <code>git</code> command</h5>
<p>First add a new remote pointing to the <em>opensensorhub</em> master branch (you only have to do that the first time). For example, for the osh-core repository:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core
</code></pre>

<p>Then pull changes from the "upstream" remote:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ git pull upstream master
$ git submodule update
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note 1: The <code>submodule update</code> command is only required in the <code>osh-core</code> repo that has submodules.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 2: You may have to manually merge with your working copy if you have made conflicting changes.</em></p>
<h5 id="using-eclipse">Using Eclipse</h5>
<p>First add a new remote pointing to the <em>opensensorhub</em> master branch (you only have to do that the first time):</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the "Git Repositories" view (Window -&gt; Show view -&gt; Other -&gt; Git)</li>
<li>Open the "sensorhub" repository, right click on "Remotes" and select "Create Remote"</li>
<li>Enter "upstream" as the remote name, select "Configure fetch" and click "OK"</li>
<li>Click the "Change" button next to the URI text box</li>
<li>Enter <code>https://github.com/opensensorhub/osh-core</code> as the URI and click "Finish"</li>
<li>Click "Save"</li>
</ul>
<p>Then pull changes from the "upstream" remote:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the "Git Repositories" view (Window -&gt; Show view -&gt; Other -&gt; Git)</li>
<li>Right click on the "osh-core" repository and select "Remote -&gt; Fetch" in the popup menu</li>
<li>Select the "opensensorhub" remote in the "Configured remote repository" item and click "Finish"</li>
<li>Right click on the "Submodules" folder and select "Update Submodule" from the popup menu</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll then eventually have to merge our changes with yours using the Egit merge command. Please see <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging#Basic-Merge-Conflicts">Git Documentation</a> for more details</p>
<p>Note: Also don't forget to import new Eclipse projects that may have been added since your last update. For this, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click in your workspace and select "Import..." in the context menu</li>
<li>Select "Existing project into workspace" from the "General" section and click "Next"</li>
<li>Browse to the folder where you cloned our repo (usually called "osh-core" for the core software)</li>
<li>Select the missing projects in the list (all the projects that are not already in your workspace should already be selected) and click "Finish"</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="push-your-changes-to-your-own-repo">Push your changes to your own repo</h4>
<p>You can push your changes to your own GitHub repo at any time, even if your code doesn't work yet. Remember this is your own sandbox so you won't mess up anybody else code base. We actually recommend that you do that often since it will provide you a good backup of your work, with full history.</p>
<p>You won't be able to push directly to the opensensorhub repos directly since you don't have write permissions (not until you become part of the team anyway). </p>
<h5 id="using-the-git-command_1">Using the <code>git</code> command</h5>
<p>To do this with git command line tool, first stage and commit your changes locally:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ git commit -am &quot;Your commit message&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>and then push them to your remote GitHub repository:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ git push
</code></pre>

<p>(Please see the <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">git online documentation</a> for more details and other ways to use git)</p>
<h5 id="using-eclipse_1">Using Eclipse</h5>
<p>Within Eclipse, follow these steps:</p>
<p>To commit your changes locally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click on one of the Eclipse project with a name starting with "sensorhub"</li>
<li>Select "Team -&gt; Commit" from the popup menu</li>
<li>Enter a commit message and select files you want to commit</li>
<li>Click "Commit" (or "Commit and Push" if you want to commit locally and push to your remote repository in a single step)</li>
<li>If you have just pressed "Commit" you will see a arrow with a number on the right of the project names in the package explorer. This indicates that you have N local changes that need to be pushed to the remote repository (i.e. in git terms, your local repository is N commits ahead of your remote).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you only want to push your last committed changes to your remote repository:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click on one of the Eclipse project with a name starting with "sensorhub"</li>
<li>Select "Team -&gt; Push to Upstream" from the popup menu</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
</ul>
<p>(Please see <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide">Egit online documentation</a> for more advanced functionality)</p>
